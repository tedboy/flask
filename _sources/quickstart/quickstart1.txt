A Minimal Application
---------------------

A minimal Flask application looks something like this::

    from flask import Flask
    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def hello_world():
        return 'Hello, World!'

So what did that code do?

1. First we imported the :class:`~flask.Flask` class.  An instance of this
   class will be our WSGI application.
2. Next we create an instance of this class. The first argument is the name of
   the application's module or package.  If you are using a single module (as
   in this example), you should use ``__name__`` because depending on if it's
   started as application or imported as module the name will be different
   (``'__main__'`` versus the actual import name). This is needed so that
   Flask knows where to look for templates, static files, and so on. For more
   information have a look at the :class:`~flask.Flask` documentation.
3. We then use the :meth:`~flask.Flask.route` decorator to tell Flask what URL
   should trigger our function.
4. The function is given a name which is also used to generate URLs for that
   particular function, and returns the message we want to display in the
   user's browser.

Just save it as :file:`hello.py` or something similar. Make sure to not call
your application :file:`flask.py` because this would conflict with Flask
itself.

To run the application you can either use the :command:`flask` command or
python's ``-m`` switch with Flask.  Before you can do that you need
to tell your terminal the application to work with by exporting the
``FLASK_APP`` environment variable::

    $ export FLASK_APP=hello.py
    $ flask run
     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/

If you are on Windows you need to use ``set`` instead of ``export``.

Alternatively you can use :command:`python -m flask`::

    $ export FLASK_APP=hello.py
    $ python -m flask run
     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/

This launches a very simple builtin server, which is good enough for testing
but probably not what you want to use in production. For deployment options see
:ref:`deployment`.

Now head over to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/ <http://127.0.0.1:5000/>`_, and you
should see your hello world greeting.

.. _public-server:

.. note:: **Externally Visible Server**

   If you run the server you will notice that the server is only accessible
   from your own computer, not from any other in the network.  This is the
   default because in debugging mode a user of the application can execute
   arbitrary Python code on your computer.

   If you have the debugger disabled or trust the users on your network,
   you can make the server publicly available simply by adding
   ``--host=0.0.0.0`` to the command line::

       flask run --host=0.0.0.0

   This tells your operating system to listen on all public IPs.
